## USER
I want to test a strategy that buys on open and sells on close if gap one day to another is above 50bps (should compare previous close to today open)
write a python code that receives a dataframe with columns date, open close and calculates the daily pnl of the strategy

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's an example Python code that implements the strategy you described:

```python
import pandas as pd

def gap_strategy(df):
    # Calculate the daily returns
    df['returns'] = df['close'] / df['close'].shift(1) - 1
    
    # Calculate the gap between previous close and today open
    df['gap'] = df['open'] / df['close'].shift(1) - 1
    
    # Initialize the position as zero
    position = 0
    
    # Initialize the P&L as zero
    pnl = 0
    
    # Loop through each row of the DataFrame
    for i in range(1, len(df)):
        # Check if the gap is greater than 50 bps
        if abs(df['gap'][i]) > 0.005:
            # If the gap is positive, buy on open
            if df['gap'][i] > 0:
                position += 1
                pnl -= df['open'][i]
            # If the gap is negative, sell on open
            else:
                position -= 1
                pnl += df['open'][i]
        
        # If the gap is not greater than 50 bps, close the position
        else:
            pnl += position * (df['close'][i] - df['open'][i])
            position = 0
    
    # Return the daily P&L
    df['pnl'] = df['returns'] * (df['close'].shift(-1) * position) + pnl
    
    return df['pnl']
```

You can then apply this function to a DataFrame with columns `date`, `open`, and `close` to calculate the daily P&L of the strategy:

```python
# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-01-02', '2022-01-03', '2022-01-04', '2022-01-05'],
    'open': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    'close': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
})

# Apply the gap strategy and print the result
print(gap_strategy(df))
```

This should output the daily P&L of the strategy for the given DataFrame. Note that you may need to adjust the code to match the format of your input DataFrame.
